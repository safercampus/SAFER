# How your donation helps
Supporting SAFER ensures that students will have the tools they need to make their voices heard in the fight against sexual assault. Your contribution helps SAFER provide low or no cost training and mentoring to students who are working to change their schools' policies and culture. Dozens of student groups from campuses all over the country have called upon SAFER to guide their policy change movements, and we have been honored to provide them with the knowledge base and strategy they need. 

Supporting SAFER also means that you are helping us to conduct research on the sexual assault policies and practices at colleges and universities around the country. Our research has been a vital resource for students, parents, administrators, and lawmakers who are writing national policy informed by our findings and recommendations.
