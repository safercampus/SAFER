# What is a teach-in?

The SAFER Teach-In is specifically tailored and designed for students wanting to bolster their campaign efforts for sexual assault policy reform; we’re interested in supporting all types of students ranging from those who have a ton of experience organizing to those who are just getting ready to dive in. The teach-in is typically 4 hours long and can either be held on a weekday or weekend. The teach-in will provide you the information you need to build an effective coalition of activists and organize for change on your campus. Teach-in participants will have access to our free service, the Activist Mentoring Program, AMP(!).

To start, participants receive a copy of their policy and analyze it with an experienced SAFER Trainer to:

* Discuss the current process of reporting and disciplinary procedures
* Analyze what the strengths and weaknesses of your school’s policy is
* Examine the ways that different communities on and off campus are affected by policy
* Communities of faith, athletes, LGBT students, women, students of color
* Learn what a strong, fair, and comprehensive policy should contain
* How sexual assault intersects with other forms of oppression
* Analyze the power dynamics of your college
* Learn effective tactics to change campus culture, implement prevention efforts 
* Improve crisis response and disciplinary processes

While we believe there is no ‘one size fits all’ policy approach, SAFER encourages college activists to consider their work in the context of a larger, national movement. There are so many powerful advocates in the fight to prevent college sexual assault, and we want to give you the tools to build important relationships to make your individual movement stronger, more cohesive, and effective. In other words, SAFER is ready to help you think through the tough stuff and given our experience organizing with many colleges, there is no doubt that we can truly ignite change together!

# Post Teach-In Mentoring

Any student group that hosts a SAFER Teach-In has access to 20 hours of free mentoring from the SAFER trainer. Two weeks after your Teach-In, your trainer will send your group an individualized plan that outlines the goals identified at the Teach-In and offers some initial resources to get you started.   Your mentor is always there to take your questions, offer advice, and help strategize. Mentors can assist with a number of issues and needs bound to come up during your campaign, including: 

* Strategizing about how to gain allies and a critical mass of supporters
* Proofreading policy drafts or letters to administration
* Developing a more comprehensive and campus-specific list of demands for a revised sexual assault policy
* Brainstorming solutions to organizing roadblocks as they occur, such as turnout, coalition building, and diversity

Mentoring allows your movement to develop the knowledge and skills gained at the training. As the facilitator of your Teach-In, your mentor will be able to provide tailored support to the specifics of your campus situation and give unique insight to challenges that come up.  Mentoring may be especially helpful in difficult situations such as a large-scale media attack by an opposition group, a change in college leadership, or conflict between activists.
